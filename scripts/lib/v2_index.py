"""The one correct traversal of the three V2 id layers.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. The layers do not link the way they look like they do:

    seed id        ikmk-18297645, dk-hede-c4h2      stable (§9b)
    unified id     unified-<top-authority seed id>  renames on a merge decision
    final id       follows the unified

    seed_unified[].composed_of  →  SEED ids
    final[].composed_of         →  UNIFIED ids, and sometimes seed ids directly

The same field name means a different layer at each level. Every ad-hoc probe
that walks it by hand has to rediscover that, and the ones that get it wrong do
not fail — they return a confident, plausible, empty answer. Five such probes
in one session (2026-08-25) reported, in turn: «0 of 14 077 kmk seeds reach
final» and «0 of 166 coins relocated, 166 dead». Both were pure key mismatch;
the true answers were «nearly all» and «165 of 166».

`trace_coin.py` had the correct traversal all along, and CLAUDE.md §9b already
says to use it. It stayed unused because it lived inside a CLI script behind
five canned subcommands, so any question they did not answer was cheaper to
hand-roll than to reach — and 55 files across scripts/ now walk `composed_of`
themselves. This module makes the correct thing the cheap thing: one import,
and a lookup on the wrong layer RAISES instead of quietly missing.

    from lib.v2_index import V2Index
    idx = V2Index.load()
    idx.seed("ikmk-18297645")          # → placement, or KeyError
    idx.seed("unified-ikmk-18297645")  # → LayerError, naming the mistake
    idx.resolve(any_id)                # → ("seed"|"unified"|"final", record)
