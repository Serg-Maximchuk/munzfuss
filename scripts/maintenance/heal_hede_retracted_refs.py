"""Drop seed catalogue values the danskmoent parser has RETRACTED.

WHY THIS IS NEEDED AT ALL
-------------------------
`catalog` is in the hede builder's DEEP_MERGE_FIELDS and its sub-fields are
list-capable, so a regeneration UNIONS the fresh emission with whatever the
seed already holds. It can add, never subtract. A parser fix that stops
emitting a wrong value therefore changes nothing on its own — verified twice
now, most recently after the 2026-08-07 off-strike-aside fix, where a re-seed
moved only the `generated_at` timestamp.

WHAT IT REMOVES, AND WHY THAT IS SAFE
-------------------------------------
Only a value that is ALL THREE of:

  1. present in the seed,
  2. absent from the CURRENT parser output for that page,
  3. present in the PREVIOUS parser output (read from the cache submodule's
     git HEAD).

(3) is the safeguard. It means the parser itself used to emit the value and
has now retracted it — so the removal follows a deliberate parser change and
cannot touch a curator's own addition, a value contributed by another source,
or anything the parser never claimed. A plain «sync the seed to the parser»
would delete all three of those.

Run it right after a `parse_hede.py --force` + `build_hede_denmark_seed.py`
pair, while the submodule still holds the pre-fix parse at HEAD.

# cannot remove it, only a heal can. But a heal makes the register shrink, and
# a shrinking register is exactly what verify_reflow is built to block — three
# separate times in one day (KM in the finals, the sibling-Schou heal, then
# this one) a correct, verified cleanup was stopped by the gate with no way to
# tell it apart from real loss.
#
# This file is that record, and it is the same shape as data/v2/exclusions/:
# a deliberate removal, written down, so the gate can distinguish it from data
# falling on the floor. Without it the only way through is --no-verify, and a
