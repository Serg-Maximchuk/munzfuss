"""Record the readings a SOURCE-SANITY gate refused, so the re-flow gate can tell
them apart from data falling on the floor.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
A source sometimes prints a number that cannot be what it claims. NGC's own
specification table gives «Fineness: 35.5000» on the Norwegian gold off-strikes
struck from Speciedaler dies, 58.0 on two different nominals and 40.7 on four —
a 12-Ducat, a 3-Ducat and two 2-Ducats alike. Shared across nominals of
different size, so not a per-piece weight either; what the field holds there
cannot be established from the page, and `parse_ngc.sift_fineness` therefore
REFUSES it rather than reinterpreting it (guessing would be §0b invention).

That refusal makes a measurement list shrink in the finals, and a shrinking list
is exactly what `verify_reflow` is built to block. Without a record the only way
through is `--no-verify`, and a gate routinely bypassed protects nothing — the
same reasoning that produced `data/v2/exclusions/` for coins and
`_retracted_refs.yml` for catalogue registers. This is the third member of that
family, for measurement readings.

It is a SEPARATE file from `_retracted_refs.yml` for a mechanical reason:
`heal_hede_retracted_refs.py` rewrites that one wholesale, so a second author
sharing it would be silently wiped on the next heal run.

WHAT AN ENTRY EXCUSES
---------------------
Exactly one value, of exactly one field, on the coins carrying exactly one seed.
Nothing else: another value in the same shrink, another field on the same coin,
a citation dropped, a coin gone — all still block. An entry can never become a
blanket amnesty.

The ledger is DERIVED, never hand-written: every entry is reconstructed from the
parser cache, where the refused number is preserved as `fineness_unusable_raw`
beside a `flags.fineness_unusable` marker. Re-run this after any parser-gate
change and the ledger follows.

Usage::
