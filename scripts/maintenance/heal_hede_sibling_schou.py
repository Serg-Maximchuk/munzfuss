"""Strip Schou values that belong to a SIBLING Hede on the same danskmoent page.

WHY A HEAL AND NOT JUST A RE-SEED
---------------------------------
`catalog` is in the hede builder's DEEP_MERGE_FIELDS and `schou` is
list-capable, so a regeneration UNIONS the fresh value with whatever the seed
already holds. It can add, never subtract. The contaminated values therefore
survive every re-seed — verified 2026-08-07: a full builder run changed nothing
but the `generated_at` timestamp, and dk-hede-nc5h11 still read `['2', '5']`.

WHAT WAS CONTAMINATED
---------------------
A danskmoent page that documents several Hede numbers carries a page-level
`catalog_refs` roll-up alongside the correct per-Hede breakdown in
`specs.by_hede`. Seeds built before the parser emitted the per-Hede refs took
the roll-up, so each sub-Hede got the union of its siblings' Schou numbers:

    nc5h11.json  by_hede 11 → Schou 5   ·  by_hede 12 → Schou 2
    page-level   Schou ['5', '2']
    both seeds   Schou ['2', '5']       ← wrong on both

That matters beyond display: `schou/<ruler>` is a matching key in the
cross-source merger (measured cross-reign collision 64 %), so a borrowed value
is a FALSE unifying edge — exactly the §9.4 evidence a merge is allowed to rest
on. dk-hede-nc5h11 and dk-hede-nc5h12 are two different coins that appeared to
share Schou 2 and 5.

The builder is already correct for these pages — it passes
`sub_spec["catalog_refs"]` as an override — so once the stale value is gone the
union of (healed seed, fresh emission) is correct and stays correct.

SCOPE — deliberately narrow
---------------------------
Only removes a value that is BOTH absent from the sub-Hede's own
`catalog_refs` AND present in a sibling's on the same page. Values that are
merely unexplained (not the sub's, not a sibling's — 11 seeds, mostly
comma-joined parse artefacts and Zincksamlingen afslag rows) are LEFT ALONE
and listed at the end for review; guessing at those is how a heal turns into
data loss.

Single-Hede pages have their own contamination shape — a Schou scraped from a
prose cross-reference to an off-strike, e.g. c7h25 «Findes også i guld …
Schou 7a» — which this script does NOT touch. `by_hede` is empty there, so
there is no per-Hede truth to compare against; that one has to be fixed in
parse_hede.py and needs a re-parse.

RE-RUNNING IT
-------------
After the 2026-08-07 pass, a dry run still reports ONE seed: dk-hede-c5h40,
Schou ['3'] where the cache says 2. Do NOT keep applying it there. That value
is not sibling contamination the heal can settle — the BUILDER re-emits ['3']
for c5h40 on the very next run (and c5h39 carries ['4'], a number that appears
nowhere on the page). Applying and re-seeding in a loop just alternates the two
states. It belongs with the parse_hede.py work, not here.
