"""An --entity nobody has a seed for must fail, not succeed over zero coins.

`--entity danish_realm,danish_norway` looks like it ought to work and doesn't:
the flag takes ONE entity, so the comma-joined string matches no seed file. The
run then completed normally, wrote the unified yamls, and reported

    Per-source seeds total:  0
    Unified entries total:   0
    ✓ Wrote unified yamls to …/data/v2/seed_unified/

which reads as «nothing to merge», not as «you asked for an entity that doesn't
exist». The re-flow it was supposed to perform silently didn't happen, and the
next step in the chain — absorb, then the reflow gate — would have measured
against a tree nobody had re-merged (CLAUDE.md §9b: the baseline was not what
the caller assumed).
